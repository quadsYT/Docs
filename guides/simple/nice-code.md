# Clean Code

## Introduction

Have you looked at your code but can't read it?

And look. The code is working but it will take some time to understand it, which you might forget later in the future.

### How to clean it?

First, lets look at our code.

From a new comer, they wouldn't know what is going on, and would be super confused and probably not learn anything. The best way to learn is to look at other peoples code. It works, but it's ugly.

Lets clean it up. First lets right click on the parent block.

Now lets click on "Align Descendants."

Much better! But a new player still doesn't know what this code means. Lets use some comments.

Great! It went from something no one could understand to something even new players could understand! This makes block scripting more accessible to new comers so they can learn from other people.
